README - Database Project

This document provides an overview of the EDI retrival project. 
The project involves creating and populating a table that rapresent a collection of different types of file, then perform a query that can search terms into files names, directory names and into html file.


The project was reapeted with two different scenario:

Scenario 1: This table was populated using a small set of files. It was designed to examine a representative sample of data and experiment with query operations on specific data.
Scanario 2: In contrast to the first table, this one was populated using all files present in the file system of my virtual machine. The main goal of this table is to explore database performance when working with a large amount of data.


Attribute of table
id - primary key autoincremented
file_type - type of the file ex- directory, HTML Document, Python document, etc.
path - path of the file 
file_name - name of the file
dimension - dimension of the file in byte
last_modify - date and time of the last modify
owner - owner of the file
content - content of the file, if HTML. Null otherwise.

Cardinality of Tables
The cardinality of the tables indicated in the project is as follows:

Scanario 1: file_info  105
Scenario 2: file_info2 68895
